Training a model
=================

Neural networks are powerful machine learning tools in principle capable of
approximating any function. In MALA, neural networks are built using PyTorch.
Hyperparameter optimization can be done using optuna and custom routines.
To see how a model is trained, refer to e.g. ``ex01_singleshot``.
